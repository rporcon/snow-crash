we can see in the binary level13 file by inspecting with ltrace that a getuid() is performed and 4242 is expected
we have to inject our own shared library (see level13.c) to override the getuid():
	gcc -shared -fPIC level13.c -o level13.so
but that's not enough because to inject it the dynamic library must also have the suid set (since the binary has  setuid set)
so to solve that we need to use a binary without setuid set to execute level13 binary:
	LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/level13.so ltrace ~/level13
