level 10 binary use access to verify permission of the file given as argument
if we have permission then the file is open and sent on 127.0.0.1:6969
(to listen to the program, we use: netcat -k -l 6969)
there is a token file without permission that we need to read
since there is a huge warning in the access man that said to not use it because of race condition
we just have to exploit that race condition (see level10.sh)
